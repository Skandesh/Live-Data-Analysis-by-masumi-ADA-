🧠 Project Title:
Live Data Analysis by Masumi (ADA) (AI-Driven Cybersecurity Policy Analyzer with On-Chain Monetization)

🚀 Abstract
Live Data Analysis by Masumi (ADA) is an AI-powered, multi-agent cybersecurity policy analyzer that enables organizations to evaluate, score, and enhance their security policies in real-time — with automated compliance mapping to international standards such as NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, and India’s DPDP Act 2023.

The system is built using the Masumi Agent Framework, leveraging CrewAI multi-agent orchestration and Masumi’s decentralized payment network on Cardano. This allows organizations to pay securely in ADA tokens for advanced analysis while ensuring a trustless and transparent AI service economy.

The application consists of three cooperative AI agents:

🧾 Reader Agent – Extracts and structures key sections from uploaded security policies.
🔍 Compliance Checker Agent – Maps clauses against standard cybersecurity controls, identifying strengths and gaps.
💡 Recommendation Agent – Suggests improvements and drafts missing policy statements.
Users receive an instant compliance score for free, and can unlock a detailed compliance report through a Masumi-powered ADA micropayment. This design showcases a practical integration of AI governance, cybersecurity, and Web3 monetization — enabling small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to audit policies affordably and securely.

ADA demonstrates how AI agents can be monetized directly on-chain, bridging the gap between AI services and blockchain-based compliance automation.

💻 Tech Stack
AI / Agent Layer: CrewAI + FastAPI
LLM: OpenAI GPT-4 (or Gemini / LLaMA alternative)
Payment Layer: Masumi Payment Service (Cardano ADA)
Frameworks: Python, FastAPI, Docker
Standards Referenced: NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, DPDP Act 2023
🎯 Impact
Promotes cyber resilience for startups and enterprises.
Introduces a pay-per-use AI model via on-chain payments.
Encourages AI-driven compliance automation using decentralized trust.
🏆 Use Case Example
A startup uploads its “Information Security Policy.” → ADA evaluates and returns:

Compliance Score: 62%
Gaps: No data-retention policy, missing MFA controls. → After ADA micropayment:
Full Report: NIST/ISO control table + AI-generated recommendations for compliance improvement.
