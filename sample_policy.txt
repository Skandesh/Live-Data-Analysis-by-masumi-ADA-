INFORMATION SECURITY POLICY
Version 1.0
Date: October 2025

1. ACCESS CONTROL
Our organization implements strict access control measures to protect information assets. All users must be authenticated before accessing systems. User accounts are managed through a formal provisioning process. Access permissions are based on the principle of least privilege.

2. AUTHENTICATION
All systems require strong passwords with minimum 12 characters. Password changes are enforced every 90 days. We are implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all critical systems by Q1 2025.

3. AUDIT AND LOGGING
System activities are logged and monitored continuously. Audit logs are retained for a minimum of 12 months. Regular audit log reviews are conducted weekly by the security team.

4. INCIDENT RESPONSE
We maintain a 24/7 incident response team. All security incidents must be reported within 1 hour of detection. Incident response procedures are tested quarterly through tabletop exercises.

5. DATA PROTECTION
Sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit using AES-256 encryption. Data classification is performed to identify critical assets. We comply with GDPR requirements for data protection.

6. BACKUP AND RECOVERY
Daily backups are performed for all critical systems. Backup data is stored in geographically diverse locations. Recovery procedures are tested monthly to ensure effectiveness.

7. COMPLIANCE
Our security program aligns with ISO 27001 standards. Regular compliance assessments are conducted annually. We maintain compliance with applicable regulations including GDPR.
